    <h1>Olimar Version 2.2:</h1>
    <p>ADDED:
<br>      -?v command, which gives current version and changelog
<br>      -Opinion censorship
<br>      -?bugreport command which allows bugs to be reported, self explanatory
<br>      -Error messages whe certain commands are misused (Namely ?roll)
<br>      FIXED:
<br>      - Now sends appropriate message when people first join a server
<br>      -?smut small would actually just take sentances from the dataset and send it, bad olimar... now it functions the same as ?text small
<br>      CHANGED:
<br>      -Reverted to original smut dataset
<br>      -Olimar dataset
